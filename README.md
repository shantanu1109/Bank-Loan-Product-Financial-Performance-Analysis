# Bank-Loan-Product-and-Financial-Performance-Analysis

Welcome to the **Bank Loan Product and Financial Performance Analysis** repository! This project offers an in-depth analysis and visualization of bank loan data, aimed at enhancing decision-making for financial institutions. Using Power BI, this project provides dynamic and interactive dashboards to track and understand key metrics in lending operations.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing various aspects of bank loans and includes three core dashboards: **Summary**, **Overview**, and **Details**. Each dashboard serves a distinct purpose, providing insights into loan performance, regional trends, borrower profiles, and financial metrics essential for managing a loan portfolio.

### Dashboards Breakdown

#### Dashboard 1: Summary

The **Summary Dashboard** is designed to present high-level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that highlight the state of loan applications, funding, and repayment. Hereâ€™s what it covers:

- **Total Loan Applications:** Shows the count of all loan applications received, with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) comparisons.
- **Total Funded Amount:** Displays the total amount disbursed as loans, including MTD and MoM analyses to track lending volume.
- **Total Amount Received:** Provides data on repayments made by borrowers, critical for cash flow and financial health analysis.
- **Average Interest Rate:** Calculates the average interest rate across all loans, with MTD and MoM comparisons to identify trends in lending rates.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Assesses the average DTI of borrowers, a key metric in evaluating borrower risk profiles.

**Visualization: Loan Status Grid View**  
This section includes a grid view organized by 'Loan Status,' providing insights into key metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, and other KPIs to facilitate quick assessment of lending operations and borrower health.

#### Dashboard 2: Overview

The **Overview Dashboard** presents a more segmented look at loan data, helping you understand trends and patterns across various dimensions:

- **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):** Helps spot seasonal trends and long-term shifts in loan issuance.
- **Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):** Highlights regions with substantial lending activity, aiding in geographic market analysis.
- **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):** Illustrates loan distribution by term lengths, providing insights into borrower preferences.
- **Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart):** Analyzes lending metrics by borrower employment length, showing correlations with loan performance.
- **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):** Displays loan metrics based on borrowers' stated purposes, offering a view into the primary drivers of borrowing.
- **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):** Breaks down loan data by home ownership status, showing how property ownership impacts lending and repayment.

#### Dashboard 3: Details

The **Details Dashboard** offers a comprehensive look at loan-related metrics for deeper analysis of each loan's characteristics and borrower demographics. It allows for streamlined access to essential data points, which can improve decision-making, operational efficiency, and lending strategy development.

### Key Benefits

The insights from these dashboards enable financial institutions to:
- **Optimize Lending Strategies:** By understanding borrower profiles and market trends.
- **Improve Cash Flow Management:** Through detailed analysis of repayment trends.
- **Mitigate Risk:** By assessing borrower DTI ratios, interest rates, and loan purposes.
- **Enhance Operational Efficiency:** With streamlined access to important metrics and KPIs.
